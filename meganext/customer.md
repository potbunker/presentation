# Managing Customers

* Aware of current and future customers
* Study past customers. Those who left tells MUCH RICHER story
* Manage Market
* See what they do. Don't listen to your customers. 

## Customers want Simplicity


Note:
From the game of Go
Know when to fold. When to give up. When to say no.

Why do you value customers you don't have more than customers you have?
