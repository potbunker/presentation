# Managing Customers

* Aware of current and future customers
* Study past customers. Those who left tells MUCH RICHER story
* See what they do. Don't listen to your customers. 

Note:

Why do you value customers you don't have more than customers you have?

Know when to fold. When to give up. When to say no.
