# Product Management

* Don't let the perfect be the enemy of good
* Timing is everything
* Attention to detail
* Measure everything

## Product must solve problems

1. Sometimes the product must expose the problem before solving them
2. It must solve the problem only slightly better than the current solution

## Seeing what your customers see

1. Lamp/Fire
